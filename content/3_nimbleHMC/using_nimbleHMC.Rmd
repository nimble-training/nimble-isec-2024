# Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling


No-U-Turn sampling


# Popularity of HMC

- Stan
- articles

# What's in `nimbleHMC`

- sampler following Stan
- NUTS classic


# Adding an HMC sampler to an MCMC

- build, compile run, ...



# Comparison of HMC vs. non-HMC


# Summary

- HMC can give better mixing; but at a higher computational cost
- No certainty of what appraoch is best; problem dependent
